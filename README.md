# Colab Project - Rest API with Database and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Welcome to the Colab Project on GitHub! üöÄ

**Innovating Collaboratively for a More Connected Future.**

This project is a suggestion from a friend named Mir! It's here to validate each step of the project, offering a unique opportunity to enhance our portfolio and improve our programming skills.

## What is This?

Imagine building something different together! The Colab Project is more than a Rest API; it's a creative idea for collaborative development. We are here to create an amazing tool that goes beyond the traditional task listing, providing unique experiences for those seeking innovation.

## How Does It Work?

We demystify development for you. Follow these steps and watch the magic happen:

1. **Installation:** Run `npm install` to set everything up.
2. **Execution:** Start the Colab Project with `npm start` and get ready to be amazed!

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Web Framework:** Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Testing Tool:** Mocha

## Features

The Colab Project will include the following features:

### HTTP Methods:

- **GET:** Retrieve user information.
- **POST:** Add a new user.
- **PUT:** Update information for an existing user.
- **DELETE:** Delete a user.

### Data Storage:

We will use the MongoDB Atlas database to store and manage user information persistently.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD):

We are committed to the TDD methodology to ensure that our code is robust and error-free from the beginning. This means we will create automated tests before writing the implementation code.
